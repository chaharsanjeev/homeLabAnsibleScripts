############################### START DETECT SECTION ################################
# Optional: Detect configuration
# NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
detect:
  width: 1280         # Optional: width of the frame for the input with the detect role (default: use native stream resolution)
  height: 720         # Optional: height of the frame for the input with the detect role (default: use native stream resolution)
  fps: 5              # Optional: desired fps for your camera for the input with the detect role. Recommended value of 5. Ideally, try and reduce your FPS on the camera.
  enabled: true       # Optional: enables detection for the camera (default: True)
  #min_initialized: 2  # Optional: Number of consecutive detection hits required for an object to be initialized in the tracker. (default: 1/2 the frame rate)
  #max_disappeared: 25 # Optional: Number of frames without a detection before Frigate considers an object to be gone. (default: 5x the frame rate)
  #stationary:         # Optional: Configuration for stationary object tracking
        ### Optional: Frequency for confirming stationary objects (default: same as threshold)
        ### When set to 1, object detection will run to confirm the object still exists on every frame.
        ### If set to 10, object detection will run to confirm the object still exists on every 10th frame.
    #interval: 50
    #threshold: 50   # Optional: Number of frames without a position change for an object to be considered stationary (default: 10x the frame rate or 10s)
    ### Optional: Define a maximum number of frames for tracking a stationary object (default: not set, track forever)
    ### This can help with false positives for objects that should only be stationary for a limited amount of time.
    ### It can also be used to disable stationary object tracking. For example, you may want to set a value for person, but leave
    ### car at the default.
    ### WARNING: Setting these values overrides default behavior and disables stationary object tracking.
    ###          There are very few situations where you would want it disabled. It is NOT recommended to
    ###          copy these values from the example config into your config unless you know they are needed.
    #max_frames:
      ### Optional: Default for all object types (default: not set, track forever)
    #  default: 3000
      ### Optional: Object specific values
    #  objects:
    #    person: 1000
  ### Optional: Milliseconds to offset detect annotations by (default: shown below).
  ### There can often be latency between a recording and the detect process,
  ### especially when using separate streams for detect and record.
  ### Use this setting to make the timeline bounding boxes more closely align
  ### with the recording. The value can be positive or negative.
  ### TIP: Imagine there is an event clip with a person walking from left to right.
  ###      If the event timeline bounding box is consistently to the left of the person
  ###      then the value should be decreased. Similarly, if a person is walking from
  ###      left to right and the bounding box is consistently ahead of the person
  ###      then the value should be increased.
  ### TIP: This offset is dynamic so you can change the value and it will update existing
  ###      events, this makes it easy to tune.
  ### WARNING: Fast moving objects will likely not have the bounding box align.
  #annotation_offset: 0


############################### START OJECTS SECTION ################################
### Optional: Object configuration
### NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
objects:
  ## https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/objects

    - ups
    - package
  #- dog
  ### Optional: mask to prevent all object types from being detected in certain areas (default: no mask)
  ### Checks based on the bottom center of the bounding box of the object.
  ### NOTE: This mask is COMBINED with the object type specific mask below
  #mask: 0,0,1000,0,1000,200,0,200
  ### Optional: filters to reduce false positives for specific object types
  #filters:
    #person:
      #min_area: 5000     # Optional: minimum width*height of the bounding box for the detected object (default: 0)
      #max_area: 100000  # Optional: maximum width*height of the bounding box for the detected object (default: 24000000)
      #min_ratio: 0.5    # Optional: minimum width/height of the bounding box for the detected object (default: 0)
      #max_ratio: 2.0    # Optional: maximum width/height of the bounding box for the detected object (default: 24000000)
      #min_score: 0.5    # Optional: minimum score for the object to initiate tracking (default: 0.5)
      #threshold: 0.7    # Optional: minimum decimal percentage for tracked object's computed score to be considered a true positive (default: 0.7)
      #mask: 0,0,1000,0,1000,200,0,200 # Optional: mask to prevent this object type from being detected in certain areas (default: no mask), Checks based on the bottom center of the bounding box of the object


############################### START FFMPEG SECTION ################################
# Optional: ffmpeg configuration
# More information about presets at https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/ffmpeg_presets
ffmpeg:
  global_args: -hide_banner -loglevel warning -threads 2  # Optional: global ffmpeg args (default: -hide_banner -loglevel warning -threads 2)
  hwaccel_args: preset-nvidia-h264                        # Optional: global hwaccel args (default: []). NOTE: See hardware acceleration docs for your specific device
  input_args: preset-rtsp-generic                         # Optional: global input args (preset-rtsp-generic)
  #output_args:                                           # Optional: global output args
  #  detect: -threads 2 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p      # Optional: output args for detect streams (default: -threads 2 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p)

  #  rtmp: preset-rtmp-generic                            # Optional: output args for rtmp streams (default: preset-rtmp-generic)
  ### Optional: Time in seconds to wait before ffmpeg retries connecting to the camera. (default: 10)
  ### If set too low, frigate will retry a connection to the camera's stream too frequently, using up the limited streams some cameras can allow at once
  ### If set too high, then if a ffmpeg crash or camera stream timeout occurs, you could potentially lose up to a maximum of retry_interval second(s) of footage
  ### NOTE: this can be a useful setting for Wireless / Battery cameras to reduce how much footage is potentially lost during a connection timeout.
  #retry_interval: 10


############################### START MOTION SECTION ################################
# Optional: Motion configuration
# NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
motion:
  ### Optional: The threshold passed to cv2.threshold to determine if a pixel is different enough to be counted as motion. (default: 30)
  ### Increasing this value will make motion detection less sensitive and decreasing it will make motion detection more sensitive.
  ### The value should be between 1 and 255.
  threshold: 30
  ### Optional: The percentage of the image used to detect lightning or other substantial changes where motion detection needs to recalibrate. (default: 0.8)
  ### Increasing this value will make motion detection more likely to consider lightning or ir mode changes as valid motion.
  ### Decreasing this value will make motion detection more likely to ignore large amounts of motion such as a person approaching a doorbell camera.
  #lightning_threshold: 0.8
  ### Optional: Minimum size in pixels in the resized motion image that counts as motion (default: 10)
  ### Increasing this value will prevent smaller areas of motion from being detected. Decreasing will
  ### make motion detection more sensitive to smaller moving objects.
  ### As a rule of thumb:
  ###  - 10 - high sensitivity
  ###  - 30 - medium sensitivity
  ###  - 50 - low sensitivity
  #contour_area: 10
  ### Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging frames to determine the background (default: 0.01)
  ### Higher values mean the current frame impacts the average a lot, and a new object will be averaged into the background faster.
  ### Low values will cause things like moving shadows to be detected as motion for longer.
  ### https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/background-subtraction-in-an-image-using-concept-of-running-average/
  #frame_alpha: 0.01
  ### Optional: Height of the resized motion frame  (default: 100)
  ### Higher values will result in more granular motion detection at the expense of higher CPU usage.
  ### Lower values result in less CPU, but small changes may not register as motion.
  #frame_height: 100
  ### Optional: motion mask
  ### NOTE: see docs for more detailed info on creating masks
  #mask: 0,900,1080,900,1080,1920,0,1920
  ### Optional: improve contrast (default: shown below)
  ### Enables dynamic contrast improvement. This should help improve night detections at the cost of making motion detection more sensitive
  ### for daytime.
  #improve_contrast: True
  ### Optional: Delay when updating camera motion through MQTT from ON -> OFF (default: 30).
  #mqtt_off_delay: 30


############################### START RECORD SECTION ################################
### Optional: Record configuration
### NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
### As of Frigate 0.12 if there is less than an hour left of storage, the oldest 2 hours of recordings will be deleted.
record:
  enabled: true               # Optional: Enable recording (default: false). If recording is disabled in the config, turning it on via the UI or MQTT later will have no effect.

    mode: motion              # Optional: Mode for retention. Available options are: all, motion, and active_objects. this mode only applies when the days setting above is greater than 0
  events:                     # Optional: Event recording settings
    pre_capture: 5            # Optional: Number of seconds before the event to include (default: 5)

    # objects:                  # Optional: Objects to save recordings for. (default: all tracked objects) : https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/objects
    ## required_zones: []  # Optional: Restrict recordings to objects that entered any of the listed zones (default: no required zones)
    retain:     # Optional: Retention settings for recordings of events
      default: 120          # Required: Default retention days (default: 10)
      mode: motion          # Optional: Mode for retention. Values - all, motion,active_objects
      objects:              # Optional: Per object retention days
        person: 120         # number of days to retuan for person
  export:   ### Optional: Recording Export Settings
      ### Optional: Timelapse Output Args (default: shown below).
      ### NOTE: The default args are set to fit 24 hours of recording into 1 hour playback.
      ### See https://stackoverflow.com/a/58268695 for more info on how these args work.
      ### As an example: if you wanted to go from 24 hours to 30 minutes that would be going
      ### from 86400 seconds to 1800 seconds which would be 1800 / 86400 = 0.02.
      ### The -r (framerate) dictates how smooth the output video is.
      ### So the args would be -vf setpts=0.02*PTS -r 30 in that case.
    timelapse_args: -vf setpts=0.04*PTS -r 30
